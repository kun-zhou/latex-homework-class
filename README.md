This is a very simple LaTeX class for homework and exams alike. Please see test.pdf to see an example. In fact, this is my very first LaTeX class. I wrote this during my final week (study week before finals) to write my Topology Exam.

Use `\problem` to start a problem and the `answer` environment to start an answer.
